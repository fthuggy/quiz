# 🎬 Celebrity Quiz

An interactive quiz game where you can test your knowledge about celebrities! This project was one of my first during my education and was created as a way to learn the basics of working with APIs, game logic, and frontend development.

## 📌 About the Project

Celebrity Quiz fetches questions from an API and presents them in a quiz format. The game keeps track of answers, score, and overall game flow, and is built entirely using web technologies.

This project helped me gain hands-on experience with:

* Fetching and handling data from an API
* Building game logic (questions, answers, scoring)
* Structuring a simple interactive application

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

## 🎯 Purpose

The main purpose of this project was learning. It was an early step in my journey as a developer and helped me understand how APIs and JavaScript logic work together in a real project.
